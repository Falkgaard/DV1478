# Diary, Week 20

# Monday

Feeling under the weather... continuing the work I began last friday.

# Tuesday

Definitely sick again. Mostly done with the requested text, however. Just got to add some citations and move it out of Notepad and into Google Docs. Seems the meeting today is off?

# Wednesday

Continuing to refine the document. Been working on a test simulation for the algorithm. I've got the LodMatrix generator working according to my constraints, as well as some functions to compute and print stats such as average cell LOD, total number of height points etc. Waiting to hear from Lawrence.

# Thursday

Spent the day working on code, felt worse. Might take the next day off.

# Friday

Taking the day off, hopefully I'll get better over the weekend.
