# Diary, Week 20

# Monday

Still feeling sick. Will spend a couple of hours researching some relationships between cells and their values at different levels-of-detail.

# Tuesday

Feeling a bit better, still taking it slow. A bit worried about the upcoming deadline. Made some progress on the code, but should probably be spending time on the thesis draft. Not sure which to prioritize at the moment...
