# Diary, Week 18

# Monday

Been working a bit on drafting some code for the new research. Nothing uploaded to github yet.
Been working on a Cell and a CellMatrix class.

# Tuesday

Today I'll start implementing a PRNG (xoroshiro128+ or xoroshiro256+ and maybe splitmix64 for hashing of the seed).
Having a meeting with Lawrence at 16:20.
