# Diary, Week 16

# Monday

Still feel like shit. Not much luck with the research. Starting to feel rather hopeless...

# Tuesday

I think I'm starting to recover from being sick.
Going to contact Lawrence today and see if he's okay, since he hasn't replied in almost two weeks. Hopefully the situation in Dubai hasn't gotten worse. Today I've been going through pretty much all of the keywords I can think of over at SCOPUS, but nothing relevant to sky maps, sky boxes etc has come up. Not sure how to reformulate and focus my research question. :(


# Wednesday

Had a meeting with Lawrence today.  Agenda for the rest of the week: Look into techniques etc. Next meeting's on friday.
