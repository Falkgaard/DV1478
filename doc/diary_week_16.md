# Diary, Week 16

# Monday

Research, research...

# Tuesday

The same as above, plus some more preparatory work with setting up Vulkan and the project.
Feeling a bit under the weather.

# Wednesday

Not doing too well, hopefully it's just a cold and some eye irritation.
Gonna spend a couple of hours around noon and the evening to try and see if I can find something useful.

# Thursday

Got a fever. I'll only spend a couple of hours researching today.

# Friday

Got some nausea and stomach pains too. Taking the day off.
