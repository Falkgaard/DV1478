# Diary, Week 18

# Monday

Plan for the day: Find at least three relevant papers on Scopus, preferably 4, and summarize them.

# Tuesday

Gathered some more papers.

# Wednesday

Now I've gathered 20 relevant papers/books/etc. Now begins the tedious (but fun) part of reading through all of them. I'll summarize the 15 most interesting and relevant. Hopefully I'll finish around 5-8 today, then hopefully the rest tomorrow. Maybe a couple on Friday. Mailing Lawrency the list I've compiled so far after uploading this diary entry.

# Thursday

Still reviewing the material. Done with maybe four. Going to aim for around ten by the end of the day (or around fifteen by tomorrow afernoon).

# Friday

Ended up pulling an all nighter, done reviewing most of 20 papers (one was a dud and a couple I didn't get to). I've got my notes written down, not sure yet if I should just convey it orally to the supervisor if I should mail them; I'll ask during the meeting. 

Seems I lasted to just a bit past 3 PM before passing out, just woke up and it's now 10:30 PM. I haven't heard from Lawrence, but I'll wait until a not so ungodly hour and check with him tomorrow if we can have the meeting sometime during the weekend or maybe on Monday instead. Sorry, I hope it didn't cause an inconvenience!

And it just dawned on me that I haven't had a meal in like 60 hours, so first thing's first... food! :D
