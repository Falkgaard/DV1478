# Diary, Week 18

# Monday

Plan for the day: Find at least three relevant papers on Scopus, preferably 4, and summarize them.

# Tuesday

Gathered some more papers.

# Wednesday

Now I've gathered 20 relevant papers/books/etc. Now begins the tedious (but fun) part of reading through all of them. I'll summarize the 15 most interesting and relevant. Hopefully I'll finish around 5-8 today, then hopefully the rest tomorrow. Maybe a couple on Friday. Mailing Lawrency the list I've compiled so far after uploading this diary entry.
